Problem 1

a.) the status of README would be untracked because nothing has been done to the file.

b.) README is modified beacuse whats inside have been changed and fun_problem.txt is untracked because git does not have information on the file since it previously did not exist.

c.) README and funproblem are both staged because the files are all good to be committed.

d.) Both the files would be modified despite the commit because the files where changed after the fact they were committed and are thus modified.

e.) The readme file would be staged because it is added and ready to be committed and funproblem would be unmodified. There is nothing in the fun_problem.txt for it to be outputted because checkout goes back to unmodified version of the text. 

f.) ReadMe is staged and modified because changes were made after it was staged.




Problem 3

1.)I would use a map. The keys would be the different playlists as a string, and the value would be an array holding the songs and the indicies of the array would correspond to the track numbers.

2.)I would use a list because order matters when reading off a recipe and making a cake. A list of strings would be created and each step in the recipe would be an item in the list.

3.) I would use a map. The key would be file extensions as a string while the value would be a vector of strings that will hold the different programs that are able to read in the file the key is equal to.

4.)I would use a map, The key would be the TV station number as an integer and the value would be the station identification as a string.
