I have my problem 1 answers in p1_answers.txt and problem 2 answers in p2_answers.pdf.

For problem 3, you will see my implementation for the 7 functions in ulliststr.cpp.

For problem 4, my code is in stackstring.cpp.

For problem 5, my code is in stringparser.cpp. To compile my stringparser.cpp, just type make then the executable. I have created a makefile for problem 5 as well.
